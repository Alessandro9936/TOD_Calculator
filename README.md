## What I Learned

This project was the last one in the Javascript basic section. This section covered all the fundamental parts and concepts of the Javascript language. In the Odin Project Curriculum the last project of each section is the most challenging, but difficulties, errors and research helped me to grasp and reinforce all the fundamentals of Javascript.
